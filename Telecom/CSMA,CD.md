Carrier sense multiple access/collision detection

![[CSMA,CD.png]]

1) All subscribers listen carrier (even when send data itself)
2) All subscribers can send data if carrier is empty
3) If collision happens (while sending sender see something other than it's signal), subscriber, who see collision first, send JAM signal. Subscribers, who was sending data while JAM, wait for random time
